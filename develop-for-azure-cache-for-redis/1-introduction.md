Caching is a common technique that aims to improve the performance and scalability of a system. It does this by temporarily copying frequently accessed data to fast storage that's located close to the application. If this fast data storage is located closer to the application than the original source, then caching can significantly improve response times for client applications by serving data more quickly.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

* Explain the key scenarios Azure Cache for Redis covers and its service tiers
* Identify the key parameters for creating an Azure Cache for Redis instance and interact with the cache
* Connect an app to Azure Cache for Redis by using .NET 6
