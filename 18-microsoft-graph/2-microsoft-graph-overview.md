Microsoft Graph is the gateway to data and intelligence in Microsoft 365. It provides a unified programmability model that you can use to access the tremendous amount of data in Microsoft 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security.

In the Microsoft 365 platform, three main components facilitate the access and flow of data:

* The Microsoft Graph API offers a single endpoint, `https://graph.microsoft.com`. You can use REST APIs or SDKs to access the endpoint. Microsoft Graph also includes a powerful set of services that manage user and device identity, access, compliance, security, and help protect organizations from data leakage or loss.

* [Microsoft Graph connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftsearch/connectors-overview) work in the incoming direction, **delivering data external to the Microsoft cloud into Microsoft Graph services and applications**, to enhance Microsoft 365 experiences such as Microsoft Search. Connectors exist for many commonly used data sources such as Box, Google Drive, Jira, and Salesforce.

* [Microsoft Graph Data Connect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview#access-microsoft-graph-data-at-scale-using-microsoft-graph-data-connect) provides a set of tools to streamline secure and scalable **delivery of Microsoft Graph data to popular Azure data stores**. The cached data serves as data sources for Azure development tools that you can use to build intelligent applications.
