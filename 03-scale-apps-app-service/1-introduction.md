Autoscaling enables a system to adjust the resources required to meet the varying demand from users, while controlling the costs associated with these resources. You can use autoscaling with many Azure services, including web applications. Autoscaling requires you to configure autoscale rules that specify the conditions under which resources should be added or removed.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

* Identify scenarios for which autoscaling is an appropriate solution
* Create autoscaling rules for a web app
