In this exercise you use ACR Tasks to perform the following actions:

* Create an Azure Container Registry
* Build and push image from a Dockerfile
* Verify the results
* Run the image in the ACR

## Prerequisites

* An **Azure account** with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.com/free](https://azure.com/free)

## Sign in to Azure and start the Cloud Shell

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and open the Cloud Shell.

1. When the shell opens select the **Bash** environment.

## Create an Azure Container Registry

1. Create a resource group for the registry, replace `<myLocation>` in the following command with a location near you.

    ```bash
    az group create --name az204-acr-rg --location <myLocation>
    ```

1. Create a basic container registry. The registry name must be unique within Azure, and contain 5-50 alphanumeric characters. Replace `<myContainerRegistry>` in the following command with a unique value.

    ```bash
    az acr create --resource-group az204-acr-rg \
        --name <myContainerRegistry> --sku Basic
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The command creates a *Basic* registry, a cost-optimized option for developers learning about Azure Container Registry.

## Build and push image from a Dockerfile

Now use Azure Container Registry to build and push an image based on a local Dockerfile.

1. Create, or navigate, to a local directory and then use the following command to create the Dockerfile. The Dockerfile contains a single line that references the `hello-world` image hosted at the Microsoft Container Registry.

    ```bash
    echo FROM mcr.microsoft.com/hello-world > Dockerfile
    ```

1. Run the `az acr build` command, which builds the image and, after the image is successfully built, pushes it to your registry. Replace `<myContainerRegistry>` with the name you used earlier.

    ```azurecli
    az acr build --image sample/hello-world:v1  \
        --registry <myContainerRegistry> \
        --file Dockerfile .
    ```

    Following is a shortened sample of the output from the previous command showing the last few lines with the final results. You can see in the `repository` field the `sample/hello-word` image is listed.

    ```
    - image:
        registry: <myContainerRegistry>.azurecr.io
        repository: sample/hello-world
        tag: v1
        digest: sha256:92c7f9c92844bbbb5d0a101b22f7c2a7949e40f8ea90c8b3bc396879d95e899a
      runtime-dependency:
        registry: mcr.microsoft.com
        repository: hello-world
        tag: latest
        digest: sha256:92c7f9c92844bbbb5d0a101b22f7c2a7949e40f8ea90c8b3bc396879d95e899a
      git: {}
    
    
    Run ID: cf1 was successful after 11s
    ```

## Verify the results

1. Use the `az acr repository list` command to list the repositories in your registry. Replace `<myContainerRegistry>` with the name you used earlier.

    ```bash
    az acr repository list --name <myContainerRegistry> --output table
    ```

    Output:

    ```
    Result
    ----------------
    sample/hello-world
    ```

1. Use the `az acr repository show-tags` command to list the tags on the **sample/hello-world** repository. Replace `<myContainerRegistry>` with the name you used earlier.

    ```bash
    az acr repository show-tags --name <myContainerRegistry> \
        --repository sample/hello-world --output table
    ```

    Output:

    ```
    Result
    --------
    v1
    ```

## Run the image in the ACR

1. Run the sample/hello-world:v1 container image from your container registry by using the `az acr run` command. The following example uses `$Registry` to specify the registry where you run the command. Replace `<myContainerRegistry>` with the name you used earlier.

    ```bash
    az acr run --registry <myContainerRegistry> \
        --cmd '$Registry/sample/hello-world:v1' /dev/null
    ```

    The `cmd` parameter in this example runs the container in its default configuration, but `cmd` supports other `docker run` parameters or even other `docker` commands. 

    The following is shortened sample of the output:

    ```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the `az group delete` command to remove the resource group, the container registry, and the container images stored there.

```bash
az group delete --name az204-acr-rg --no-wait
```
