Triggers cause a function to run. A trigger defines how a function is invoked and a function must have exactly one trigger. Triggers have associated data, which is often provided as the payload of the function.

Binding to a function is a way of declaratively connecting another resource to the function; bindings may be connected as *input bindings*, *output bindings*, or both. Data from bindings is provided to the function as parameters.

You can mix and match different bindings to suit your needs. Bindings are optional and a function might have one or multiple input and/or output bindings.

Triggers and bindings let you avoid hardcoding access to other services. Your function receives data (for example, the content of a queue message) in function parameters. You send data (for example, to create a queue message) by using the return value of the function.

## Trigger and binding definitions

Triggers and bindings are defined differently depending on the development language.

| Language | Triggers and bindings are configured by... |
|--|--|
| C# class library | decorating methods and parameters with C# attributes |
| Java | decorating methods and parameters with Java annotations |
| JavaScript/PowerShell/Python/TypeScript | updating *function.json* schema |

For languages that rely on *function.json*, the portal provides a UI for adding bindings in the **Integration** tab. You can also edit the file directly in the portal in the **Code + test** tab of your function. 

In .NET and Java, the parameter type defines the data type for input data. For instance, use `string` to bind to the text of a queue trigger, a byte array to read as binary, and a custom type to de-serialize to an object. Since .NET class library functions and Java functions don't rely on *function.json* for binding definitions, they can't be created and edited in the portal. C# portal editing is based on C# script, which uses *function.json* instead of attributes.

For languages that are dynamically typed such as JavaScript, use the `dataType` property in the *function.json* file. For example, to read the content of an HTTP request in binary format, set `dataType` to `binary`:

```json
{
    "dataType": "binary",
    "type": "httpTrigger",
    "name": "req",
    "direction": "in"
}
```

Other options for `dataType` are `stream` and `string`.

## Binding direction

All triggers and bindings have a direction property in the *function.json* file:

* For triggers, the direction is always `in`
* Input and output bindings use `in` and `out`
* Some bindings support a special direction `inout`. If you use `inout`, only the **Advanced editor** is available via the **Integrate** tab in the portal.

When you use attributes in a class library to configure triggers and bindings, the direction is provided in an attribute constructor or inferred from the parameter type.

## Azure Functions trigger and binding example

Suppose you want to write a new row to Azure Table storage whenever a new message appears in Azure Queue storage. This scenario can be implemented using an Azure Queue storage trigger and an Azure Table storage output binding.

Here's a *function.json* file for this scenario.

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "type": "queueTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "order",
      "queueName": "myqueue-items",
      "connection": "MY_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING"
    },
    {
      "type": "table",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "$return",
      "tableName": "outTable",
      "connection": "MY_TABLE_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING"
    }
  ]
}
```

The first element in the `bindings` array is the Queue storage trigger. The `type` and `direction` properties identify the trigger. The `name` property identifies the function parameter that receives the queue message content. The name of the queue to monitor is in `queueName`, and the connection string is in the app setting identified by `connection`.

The second element in the `bindings` array is the Azure Table Storage output binding. The `type` and `direction` properties identify the binding. The `name` property specifies how the function provides the new table row, in this case by using the function return value. The name of the table is in `tableName`, and the connection string is in the app setting identified by `connection`.

### C# script example

Here's C# script code that works with this trigger and binding. Notice that the name of the parameter that provides the queue message content is `order`; this name is required because the `name` property value in *function.json* is `order`.

```csharp
#r "Newtonsoft.Json"

using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;

// From an incoming queue message that is a JSON object, add fields and write to Table storage
// The method return value creates a new row in Table Storage
public static Person Run(JObject order, ILogger log)
{
    return new Person() { 
            PartitionKey = "Orders", 
            RowKey = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),  
            Name = order["Name"].ToString(),
            MobileNumber = order["MobileNumber"].ToString() };  
}

public class Person
{
    public string PartitionKey { get; set; }
    public string RowKey { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string MobileNumber { get; set; }
}
```

### JavaScript example

The same *function.json* file can be used with a JavaScript function:

```javascript
// From an incoming queue message that is a JSON object, add fields and write to Table Storage
module.exports = async function (context, order) {
    order.PartitionKey = "Orders";
    order.RowKey = generateRandomId(); 

    context.bindings.order = order;
};

function generateRandomId() {
    return Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 15) +
        Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 15);
}
```

### Class library example

In a class library, the same trigger and binding information — queue and table names, storage accounts, function parameters for input and output — is provided by attributes instead of a *function.json* file. Here's an example:

```csharp
public static class QueueTriggerTableOutput
{
    [FunctionName("QueueTriggerTableOutput")]
    [return: Table("outTable", Connection = "MY_TABLE_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING")]
    public static Person Run(
        [QueueTrigger("myqueue-items", Connection = "MY_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING")]JObject order,
        ILogger log)
    {
        return new Person() {
                PartitionKey = "Orders",
                RowKey = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
                Name = order["Name"].ToString(),
                MobileNumber = order["MobileNumber"].ToString() };
    }
}

public class Person
{
    public string PartitionKey { get; set; }
    public string RowKey { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string MobileNumber { get; set; }
}
```
