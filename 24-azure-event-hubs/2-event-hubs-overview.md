Azure Event Hubs represents the "front door" for an event pipeline, often called an *event ingestor* in solution architectures. An event ingestor is a component or service that sits between event publishers and event consumers to decouple the production of an event stream from the consumption of those events. Event Hubs provides a unified streaming platform with time retention buffer, decoupling event producers from event consumers.

The following table highlights key features of the Azure Event Hubs service:

| Feature | Description |
|--|--|
| Fully managed PaaS | Event Hubs is a fully managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) with little configuration or management overhead, so you focus on your business solutions. Event Hubs for Apache Kafka ecosystems give you the PaaS Kafka experience without having to manage, configure, or run your clusters. |
| Real-time and batch processing | Event Hubs uses a partitioned consumer model, enabling multiple applications to process the stream concurrently and letting you control the speed of processing. |
| Capture event data | Capture your data in near-real time in Azure Blob storage or Azure Data Lake Storageâ€¯for long-term retention or micro-batch processing. |
| Scalable | Scaling options, like Auto-inflate, scale the number of throughput units to meet your usage needs. |
| Rich ecosystem | Event Hubs for Apache Kafka ecosystems enables Apache Kafka (1.0 and later) clients and applications to talk to Event Hubs. You don't need to set up, configure, and manage your own Kafka clusters. |

## Key concepts

Event Hubs contains the following key components:

* An **Event Hubs client** is the primary interface for developers interacting with the Event Hubs client library.  There are several different Event Hubs clients, each dedicated to a specific use of Event Hubs, such as publishing or consuming events.
* An **Event Hubs producer** is a type of client that serves as a source of telemetry data, diagnostics information, usage logs, or other log data, as part of an embedded device solution, a mobile device application, a game title running on a console or other device, some client or server based business solution, or a web site.
* An **Event Hubs consumer** is a type of client that reads information from the Event Hubs and allows processing of it. Processing may involve aggregation, complex computation and filtering. Processing may also involve distribution or storage of the information in a raw or transformed fashion. Event Hubs consumers are often robust and high-scale platform infrastructure parts with built-in analytics capabilities, like Azure Stream Analytics, Apache Spark.
* A **partition** is an ordered sequence of events that is held in an Event Hubs. Partitions are a means of data organization associated with the parallelism required by event consumers.  Azure Event Hubs provides message streaming through a partitioned consumer pattern in which each consumer only reads a specific subset, or partition, of the message stream. As newer events arrive, they're added to the end of this sequence. The number of partitions is specified at the time an Event Hubs is created and can't be changed.
* A **consumer group** is a view of an entire Event Hubs. Consumer groups enable multiple consuming applications to each have a separate view of the event stream, and to read the stream independently at their own pace and from their own position.  There can be at most five concurrent readers on a partition per consumer group; however it's recommended that there's only one active consumer for a given partition and consumer group pairing. Each active reader receives all of the events from its partition; if there are multiple readers on the same partition, then they'll receive duplicate events.
* **Event receivers**: Any entity that reads event data from an Event Hubs. All Event Hubs consumers connect via the AMQP 1.0 session. The Event Hubs service delivers events through a session as they become available. All Kafka consumers connect via the Kafka protocol 1.0 and later.
* **Throughput units** or **processing units**: Prepurchased units of capacity that control the throughput capacity of Event Hubs.
