Azure App Configuration provides a service to centrally manage application settings and feature flags. Modern programs, especially programs running in a cloud, generally have many components that are distributed in nature. Spreading configuration settings across these components can lead to hard-to-troubleshoot errors during an application deployment. Use App Configuration to store all the settings for your application and secure their accesses in one place.

App Configuration offers the following benefits:

* A fully managed service that can be set up in minutes
* Flexible key representations and mappings
* Tagging with labels
* Point-in-time replay of settings
* Dedicated UI for feature flag management
* Comparison of two sets of configurations on custom-defined dimensions
* Enhanced security through Azure-managed identities
* Encryption of sensitive information at rest and in transit
* Native integration with popular frameworks

App Configuration complements Azure Key Vault, which is used to store application secrets. App Configuration makes it easier to implement the following scenarios:

* Centralize management and distribution of hierarchical configuration data for different environments and geographies
* Dynamically change application settings without the need to redeploy or restart an application
* Control feature availability in real-time
