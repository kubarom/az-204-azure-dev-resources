In this unit you learn how to secure your apps configuration data by using:

* Customer-managed keys
* Private endpoints
* Managed identities

## Encrypt configuration data by using customer-managed keys

Azure App Configuration encrypts sensitive information at rest using a 256-bit AES encryption key provided by Microsoft. Every App Configuration instance has its own encryption key managed by the service and used to encrypt sensitive information. Sensitive information includes the values found in key-value pairs. When customer-managed key capability is enabled, App Configuration uses a managed identity assigned to the App Configuration instance to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID. The managed identity then calls Azure Key Vault and wraps the App Configuration instance's encryption key. The wrapped encryption key is then stored and the unwrapped encryption key is cached within App Configuration for one hour. App Configuration refreshes the unwrapped version of the App Configuration instance's encryption key hourly. This ensures availability under normal operating conditions.

### Enable customer-managed key capability

The following components are required to successfully enable the customer-managed key capability for Azure App Configuration:

* Standard tier Azure App Configuration instance
* Azure Key Vault with soft-delete and purge-protection features enabled
* An RSA or RSA-HSM key within the Key Vault: The key must not be expired, it must be enabled, and it must have both wrap and unwrap capabilities enabled

Once these resources are configured, two steps remain to allow Azure App Configuration to use the Key Vault key:

1.  Assign a managed identity to the Azure App Configuration instance
1.  Grant the identity `GET`, `WRAP`, and `UNWRAP` permissions in the target Key Vault's access policy.

## Use private endpoints for Azure App Configuration

You can use private endpoints for Azure App Configuration to allow clients on a virtual network (VNet) to securely access data over a private link. The private endpoint uses an IP address from the VNet address space for your App Configuration store. Network traffic between the clients on the VNet and the App Configuration store traverses over the VNet using a private link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure to the public internet.

Using private endpoints for your App Configuration store enables you to:

* Secure your application configuration details by configuring the firewall to block all connections to App Configuration on the public endpoint.
* Increase security for the virtual network (VNet) ensuring data doesn't escape from the VNet.
* Securely connect to the App Configuration store from on-premises networks that connect to the VNet using VPN or ExpressRoutes with private-peering.

## Managed identities

A managed identity from Microsoft Entra ID allows Azure App Configuration to easily access other Microsoft Entra ID-protected resources, such as Azure Key Vault. The identity is managed by the Azure platform. It doesn't require you to provision or rotate any secrets. 

Your application can be granted two types of identities:

* A **system-assigned identity** is tied to your configuration store. It's deleted if your configuration store is deleted. A configuration store can only have one system-assigned identity.
* A **user-assigned identity** is a standalone Azure resource that can be assigned to your configuration store. A configuration store can have multiple user-assigned identities.

### Add a system-assigned identity

To set up a managed identity using the Azure CLI, use the `az appconfig identity assign` command against an existing configuration store. The following Azure CLI example creates a system-assigned identity for an Azure App Configuration store named `myTestAppConfigStore`.

```bash
az appconfig identity assign \ 
    --name myTestAppConfigStore \ 
    --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

### Add a user-assigned identity

Creating an App Configuration store with a user-assigned identity requires that you create the identity and then assign its resource identifier to your store. The following Azure CLI examples create  a user-assigned identity called `myUserAssignedIdentity` and assign it to an Azure App Configuration store named `myTestAppConfigStore`.

Create an identity using the `az identity create` command:

```bash
az identity create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myUserAssignedIdentity
```

Assign the new user-assigned identity to the `myTestAppConfigStore` configuration store:

```bash
az appconfig identity assign --name myTestAppConfigStore \ 
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \ 
    --identities /subscriptions/[subscription id]/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myUserAssignedIdentity
```
