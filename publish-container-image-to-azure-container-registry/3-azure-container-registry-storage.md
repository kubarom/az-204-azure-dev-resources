Basic, Standard, and Premium Azure container registry tiers benefit from advanced Azure storage features like encryption-at-rest for image data security and geo-redundancy for image data protection. 

* **Encryption-at-rest:** All container images in your registry are encrypted at rest. Azure automatically encrypts an image before storing it, and decrypts it on-the-fly when you or your applications and services pull the image.

* **Regional storage:** Azure Container Registry stores data in the region where the registry is created, to help customers meet data residency and compliance requirements. In all regions except Brazil South and Southeast Asia, Azure may also store registry data in a paired region in the same geography. In the Brazil South and Southeast Asia regions, registry data is always confined to the region, to accommodate data residency requirements for those regions.

    If a regional outage occurs, the registry data may become unavailable and isn't automatically recovered. Customers who wish to have their registry data stored in multiple regions for better performance across different geographies or who wish to have resiliency in the event of a regional outage should enable geo-replication.

* **Zone redundancy:** A feature of the Premium service tier, zone redundancy uses Azure availability zones to replicate your registry to a minimum of three separate zones in each enabled region.

* **Scalable storage:** Azure Container Registry allows you to create as many repositories, images, layers, or tags as you need, up to the registry [storage limit](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-skus#service-tier-features-and-limits).

    High numbers of repositories and tags can impact the performance of your registry. Periodically delete unused repositories, tags, and images as part of your registry maintenance routine. Deleted registry resources like repositories, images, and tags *can't* be recovered after deletion.
